THis directory will be used for python scripts and google colab notebooks that are based on bloodstock sales

I have inlcluded the 2024 febuary script, but its pratically the same as 2018, just change the racing post url. I've then included the 2018 analysis as that was the most recent work I've done and had the most interesting findings so far. There is plenty more work to do for the next sale season.
